              Vehicle characteristics refer to the specific features and
              attributes of a car that define its performance, appearance, and
              functionality. When considering purchasing a vehicle, it's
              essential to understand its characteristics to ensure it meets
              your needs and preferences. Some common vehicle characteristics
              include:
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              2.1 Engine Type: The engine type determines the power and fuel
              efficiency of the vehicle. Common engine types include gasoline,
              diesel, hybrid, and electric.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              2.2 Transmission: Transmission refers to the mechanism that
              transfers power from the engine to the wheels. Common types
              include manual, automatic, and continuously variable transmission
              (CVT).
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              2.3 Body Style: The body style defines the overall design and
              structure of the vehicle, such as sedan, SUV, coupe, convertible,
              hatchback, or pickup truck.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              2.4 Seating Capacity: Seating capacity indicates the number of
              passengers the vehicle can accommodate comfortably. It's essential
              to consider your typical passenger load when selecting a vehicle.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              2.5 Safety Features: Safety features are designed to protect
              occupants in the event of a collision or other emergencies. These
              may include airbags, anti-lock braking system (ABS), traction
              control, electronic stability control (ESC), lane departure
              warning, and adaptive cruise control.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              2.6 Infotainment System: The infotainment system provides
              entertainment, navigation, and connectivity features within the
              vehicle. It may include touchscreen displays, Bluetooth
              connectivity, smartphone integration, satellite radio, and
              advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              2.7 Fuel Efficiency: Fuel efficiency refers to the vehicle's
              ability to maximize fuel economy, reducing the cost of ownership
              and environmental impact. It's typically measured in miles per
              gallon (MPG) for gasoline-powered vehicles and miles per gallon
              equivalent (MPGe) for electric vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Understanding these vehicle characteristics can help you make an
              informed decision when selecting a car that aligns with your
              needs, preferences, and lifestyle.

              the beginning of the warranty for new vehicles or vehicles with a
              current manufacturer's warranty is not the date of the first
              placing on the market, but the beginning of the warranty in the
